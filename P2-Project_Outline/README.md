## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Website that allows users to search for restaurants in the St. Louis area and create "To Try" lists. Will also have a random restuarant generator for when a user just can't decide, which will take the user's criteria into account and give them one fitting suggestion. Finally, a good answer for the question, "Where do you want to eat?"

### Technologies
Java

???

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll have to learn how to incorporate APIs like Google Maps and research how to make a mobile-friendly version of the site. I'm more interested in the front-end/web design aspects of coding, so I'd like to focus more on that and figure out how to build my own templates without help from Thymeleaf.
